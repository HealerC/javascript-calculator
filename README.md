# Javascript Calculator
Freecodecamp's [build a javscript calculator](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/build-a-javascript-calculator).
Front end libraries certification. 
*This is source code of the app and build*
Here's the submitted project on codepen: [Simple Calculator](https://codepen.io/HealerC/pen/abNxqGY)
The app on netlify is: [Simple Calculator](https://hcalculator.netlify.app)

## Features
- Just a simple calculator that can perform basic arithmetic calculations like +, -, / +
- Calculations (with valid expressions) can be made on the go (before you click equals button, 
you may have already gotten the answer you to the expression)
- There's a history panel which displays the history of calculations made so far *which can be cleared*
- For desktop users, there are keys on the keyboard that you can press to toggle actions on the calculator

### Note
1. The history panel saves in the browsers `localStorage` so it persists - that is history of calculations
made in previous session that was not cleared will be still be here.
2. Sometimes the calculator misbehaves. Perhaps I'll know the reason why later 
but it works well most of the time

Cheers :D
